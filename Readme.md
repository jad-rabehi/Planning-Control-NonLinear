# Path plannig and Control for some robotic systems
---

Codes in this repository are mainly based on my simulations done while following the MOOC [RobMOOC](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/robmooc.html) by Prof. Luc Jaulin about *Control of Nonlinear Robotic Systems*.

Almost of codes are in Matlab, but there are some of them in Python.
