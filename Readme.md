# Path plannig and Control for some robotic systems
---

Codes in this repository are mainly based on my simulations done in the MOOC [RobMOOC](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/robmooc.html) by Prof. Luc Jaulin about *Control of Nonliear Robotic Systems*.

Almost of codes are in Matlab, but there are some of them in Python.


## Contents

* [Quadrotor Control](https://github.com/jad-rabehi/Planning-Control-NonLinear/tree/main/Quadrotor) in Python
* [Reaction Wheel Control](https://github.com/jad-rabehi/Planning-Control-NonLinear/tree/main/ReactionWheel) in Python
* [Path planning using Bezier Polynom](https://github.com/jad-rabehi/Planning-Control-NonLinear/tree/main/Bezier-Polynom-Path) in Matlab
* [Energy-based control of Cart-Pole system](https://github.com/jad-rabehi/Planning-Control-NonLinear/tree/main/Cart-pole)

## Instructions

No toolbox need to be insttaled in Matlab.

In Python, the following librairies have to be installed: math, numpy, matplotlib and scipy.
