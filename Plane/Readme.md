# Plane Altitude Control
---


Control of a small fully autonomous plane. The model used, here, to describe its dynamics, is very strongly inspired by that of
Faser Ultra Stick by *Klein E.M.V. et., al (2006)*

## Instructions

No toolbox needed to be installed in Matlab.

Run the code, in the workspace, with:

```bash
 Plane
```
